  <p><strong>About</strong></p>
  <p>40 years ago, in a small town of Okotoks, grandpa Zach set out with a dream and a vaccum. Perfected in the harsh, Albertean winters. Granda Zach used his guile wit and cunning knowledge to invent the Zaccum Mach 3.0. Grandpa Zach grew up on a poor farmstead but always found time to work on his designs for the Zachuum. Finding time in between milking the cows and harvesting the hay. Here at Zachuum, we have taken his work and perfected it into the Zachuum Mach 5. The Zachuum with the most blades ever and out core patented cyclone technology. The Zachuum Mach 5 will suck and blow anything you throw at it! Call us to book an appointment today!</p>
